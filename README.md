# ScaliaOS

ScaliaOS provides enterprise-grade JVM infrastructure for JuliaOS's AI agent framework through a type-safe execution platform built with Scala, ZIO, and Tapir. It implements a registry-factory-executor pattern to manage and route requests across multiple agent types‚Äîincluding LLM conversational agents, blockchain trading agents, and hybrid workflows. The platform bridges Scala with JuliaOS for high-performance compute while exposing agent capabilities through a RESTful API for execution, discovery, and status checking.

# What It Does
**ScaliaOS v0.2 - Hybrid Scala + Julia AI Agent Framework**

ScaliaOS is a reactive, type-safe framework that bridges Scala's powerful JVM ecosystem with Julia's high-performance computing capabilities.
Built on ZIO for functional effects and Tapir for HTTP APIs, it provides a robust platform for deploying AI agents that leverage Julia's numerical computing strengths alongside Scala's enterprise-grade reliability.

## Current Status

**Early Development (v0.2.0-alpha)**

Currently Implements:

- ‚úÖ Registry-based architecture - Centralized agent configuration and discovery
- ‚úÖ Type-safe routing - Factory-executor pattern for agent orchestration
- ‚úÖ Live LLM agents - Real conversational AI via Scala-Julia bridge
- ‚úÖ Multi-agent support - LLM, Blockchain, and Hybrid agent types
- ‚úÖ RESTful API - Execute, list, and query agent status
- ‚úÖ Production-ready - ZIO effects, error handling, and timeout management


 **What's New in v0.2**

- Refined Architecture: Cleaner separation between core framework, agent runtime, and HTTP layer
- Enhanced Type Safety: Improved models and error handling across the Scala-Julia boundary
- Modular Design: Better organized codebase with clear domain boundaries
- Agent Registry System: New agent discovery and management capabilities
- RESTful API: Standardized endpoints for agent execution and monitoring
- Production Ready: Improved error handling, logging, and process management
- Multi-Agent Support: Built-in support for LLM, blockchain, and hybrid agents


**Coming soon:**
- More JuliaOS agent abilities
- Swarm coordination
- TestNet Blockchain Integration
- Live Blockchain Integration
- Enhanced monitoring and metrics

## Quick Start

### üõ† Prerequisites

- JDK 17+ installed
- Scala 3 and sbt installed
- Julia 1.10+ installed
- HTTPie or curl (for testing endpoints)
- Valid LLM API key (OpenAI, Groq, or compatible provider)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. Clone the Repository
bash
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scaliaOS.git
cd scaliaOS
```
3. Initialize Julia Environment
bash
```
cd julia
julia --project=@. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
cd ..
```
5. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the julia/ directory:
bash
```
# For OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

For Groq (alternative)
OPENAI_API_KEY=gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
OPENAI_MODEL=llama3-8b-8192
```
Note: Use the .env.example file as a template. The gpt-4o-mini model is recommended for OpenAI testing.

### üöÄ Running the Server
Start the ZIO HTTP server:
bash
```
sbt "server/run"
```
Expected output:
```
Starting ScaliaOS server on http://localhost:8000

Host: localhost
Port: 8000

Endpoints:
  POST http://localhost:8000/agent/run        - Execute an agent
  GET  http://localhost:8000/agent/list       - List all registered agents
  GET  http://localhost:8000/agent/:id/status - Get agent configuration

Registered Agents:
  - llm-chat-gpt4   (LLM)(Live)        - General purpose chat
  - solana-trading  (Blockchain)(Mock) - Trading on Solana
  - ai-trader       (Hybrid)(Mock)     - AI-powered trading

Server ready to accept connections
```
The server will listen on port 8000 and be ready to process agent requests.

## üß™ Quick Testing with HTTPie
**Prerequisites**

-Server running on localhost:8000
-HTTPie installed (pip install httpie or brew install httpie)
-For LLM agent: Valid OpenAI API key in julia/.env


### Test 1: List All Agents
bash
```
http GET localhost:8000/agent/list
```
What this does: Shows all registered agents and their configurations.
Expected output: JSON array with agent details (id, type, capabilities, etc.)

### Test 2: Get Agent Status
bash
```
http GET localhost:8000/agent/llm-chat-gpt4/status
```
What this does: Retrieves configuration details for a specific agent.
Expected output: Agent configuration including type, capabilities, and timeout settings.

### Test 3: LLM Chat Agent (Live - Requires API Key)
bash
```
echo '{"agentId":"llm-chat-gpt4","input":{"message":"What is ZIO?"}}' | http POST localhost:8000/agent/run
```
What this does: Sends a chat message to GPT-4 and returns the AI response.
Status: ‚úÖ LIVE - Makes real API calls to OpenAI (requires valid API key in julia/.env)
Expected output:
```
json{
  "agentId": "llm-chat-gpt4",
  "output": {
    "reply": "ZIO is a type-safe, composable library for asynchronous and concurrent programming in Scala..."
  },
  "executionTime": 1250,
  ...
}
```
Note: This will fail with "Julia process failed with exit code 1" if:

julia/.env file is missing
OpenAI API key is invalid or missing
Julia dependencies aren't installed


### Test 4: Solana Trading Agent (Mock)
bash
```
echo '{"agentId":"solana-trading","input":{"action":"analyze-market","symbol":"SOL/USDC"}}' | http POST localhost:8000/agent/run
```
What this does: Simulates market analysis for a Solana trading pair.
Status: üî∂ MOCK - Returns success without real blockchain interaction
Expected output:
```
json{
  "agentId": "solana-trading",
  "output": {
    "status": "success"
  },
  "executionTime": 1,
  "blockchainRequests": [],
  "submittedTransactions": []
}
```
Other trading commands:

bash
```
# Check balance (mock)
echo '{"agentId":"solana-trading","input":{"action":"check-balance","wallet":"mock-wallet-address"}}' | http POST localhost:8000/agent/run

# Get price (mock)
echo '{"agentId":"solana-trading","input":{"action":"get-price","token":"SOL"}}' | http POST localhost:8000/agent/run

# Execute trade (mock)
echo '{"agentId":"solana-trading","input":{"action":"execute-trade","token":"SOL","amount":1.0,"side":"buy"}}' | http POST localhost:8000/agent/run
Note: Mock mode returns minimal success responses. To enable real blockchain functionality:
```
Note: Mock mode returns minimal success responses. To enable real blockchain functionality:
- Configure Solana RPC endpoint in julia/config/config.toml
- Update agent status from "Mock" to "Live" in agent registry
- Implement full blockchain logic in Julia agent script


### Test 5: AI Trader Agent (Mock)
bash
```
echo '{"agentId":"ai-trader","input":{"operation":"analyze-market","symbol":"SOL/USDC","strategy":"momentum"}}' | http POST localhost:8000/agent/run
```
What this does: Simulates AI-powered market analysis.
Status: üî∂ MOCK - Returns success without real analysis
Expected output:
```
json{
  "agentId": "ai-trader",
  "output": {
    "status": "success"
  },
  "executionTime": 2,
  "blockchainRequests": [],
  "submittedTransactions": []
}
```
Other AI trader commands:
bash
```
# Auto-trade (mock)
echo '{"agentId":"ai-trader","input":{"operation":"auto-trade","symbol":"SOL/USDC","maxAmount":10.0,"strategy":"mean-reversion"}}' | http POST localhost:8000/agent/run

# Backtest (mock)
echo '{"agentId":"ai-trader","input":{"operation":"backtest","symbol":"SOL/USDC","strategy":"momentum","startDate":"2025-01-01","endDate":"2025-10-01"}}' | http POST localhost:8000/agent/run
```

### üîß Troubleshooting
LLM Agent Fails:
`Internal error: Julia process failed with exit code 1`
Solutions:

Create `julia/.env` with `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
Run `cd julia && julia --project=@. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'`
Check server logs for detailed Julia error

Mock Agents Return Minimal Data:
This is expected behavior. Mock agents validate the request format but don't perform real operations. To enable full functionality, implement the business logic in the corresponding Julia agent scripts.

### üéØ Quick Test Script
Create `test.sh`:
bash
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Testing ScaliaOS v0.2..."
echo ""
echo "1. List agents:"
http GET localhost:8000/agent/list
echo ""
echo "2. LLM Chat (requires API key):"
echo '{"agentId":"llm-chat-gpt4","input":{"message":"Hello!"}}' | http POST localhost:8000/agent/run
echo ""
echo "3. Trading agent (mock):"
echo '{"agentId":"solana-trading","input":{"action":"analyze-market","symbol":"SOL/USDC"}}' | http POST localhost:8000/agent/run
```
Run with: `chmod +x test.sh && ./test.sh`
